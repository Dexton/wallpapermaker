`wpmaker` creates wallpaper collages
===============================================================================

Tired of having a folder full of wallpapers and only seeing one at a time?

`wpmaker` has the ability to create collages from randomly selected images from
a folder. Also it can do the standard one-at-a-time thing.

Why is this a better solution than other *leading brands*?

`wpmaker` is cross-compatible, it works on:
- Windows XP/Vista/7
- Mac OS/X
- Gnome Linux

`wpmaker` also has plugins, I know *amazing* right?:
- No problem making `wpmaker` compatible with other systems, just add plugins
- Easy to create new collages, just add plugins

Well, this sounds way too good to be true, there must be something missing.
You're in luck, `wpmaker` is still missing a GUI.

What about these plugins, can I create one? Sure! For now though you're gonna have
to rely on the ones I've created for information on how. But, if you create
a plugin you can submit a pull request on github.com.
